# circles_music_visualizer
A music visualizer written using Processing (Java) as part my creative coding classes at Portland Community college. This version of the program requires Processing to run. I might make an executable version for JVM at some point but not yet. 

This should work with any mic input. To get full use out of it you'll need a midi controller with CC numbers 14-17 and midi note numbers 36, 38, 42, 46, 48, 50 and 52.

More complete documentation to be uploaded at a later date.
